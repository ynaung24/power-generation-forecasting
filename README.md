# Wind Power Forecasting

## Overview

Renewable energy is critical for a sustainable future, and wind power remains a promising resource to meet energy demands. This project focuses on forecasting the daily wind power output generated by a windmill. Using historical weather, turbine, and rotor data collected at 10-minute intervals from January 2018 to March 2020, our objective is to predict the wind power (`ActivePower`) for the next 15 days.

## Project Goals

- **Forecasting Task:** Predict the daily wind power that could be generated from the windmill for the next 15 days.
- **Target Variable:** The column `ActivePower` in the training dataset.
- **Evaluation Metric:** The prediction accuracy will be measured using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Data Description

The dataset includes:

- **Weather Data:** Variables that capture meteorological conditions affecting wind power.
- **Turbine Features:** Metrics related to the performance and operation of the wind turbine.
- **Rotor Features:** Data representing rotor characteristics and performance.
- **Time Interval:** Measurements taken every 10 minutes.
- **Time Period:** Data spans from January 2018 to March 2020.
